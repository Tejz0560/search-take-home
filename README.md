# Search Take-Home Assignment

This repo contains a small FastAPI backend and a TypeScript frontend. Your task is to implement:

1. A simple search endpoint + client utilities
2. A small streaming endpoint that streams text from a `.txt` file to the browser (Server-Sent Events)

## On AI Tools

We use AI tools daily and expect most candidates do too, that's fine. Tell us about your workflow in the PR description or during review; we're genuinely curious how you work with them.

That said, this exercise is designed to evaluate _your_ engineering judgment, not the raw output of a model.

We can usually tell the difference between:

- Someone using AI as a force multiplier
- Someone submitting largely unreviewed AI-generated code

The latter will not score well.

What we’re looking for:

- **You understand every line you submit.** You should be able to clearly explain design choices during review.
- **Deliberate, opinionated code.** Naming, structure, error handling, and tradeoffs should reflect intent, not default scaffolding.
- **Human-level code quality.** Clear, consistent, and maintainable. Avoid unnecessary abstractions, generic boilerplate, or over-engineered patterns.
- **Ownership of the final result.** AI can help you move faster, but the final code should feel cohesive and thoughtfully reviewed.

Optional (but encouraged):
Include a short “AI Usage” note in your PR describing how you used AI (e.g., ideation, debugging, refactoring) and what you chose to accept, modify, or reject.

Use AI freely. Just make sure the submission represents your thinking and standards.

## What You Need to Build

### 1. Backend: `POST /api/search`

In [`backend/features/search/router.py`](backend/features/search/router.py:1), you'll find a POST endpoint stub for `/api/search`.

Your job:

- Implement ranking logic over a small in-memory corpus `DOCUMENTS`
- Create and utilize FAISS vector database in [`backend/features/search/integrations.py`](backend/features/search/integrations.py:1)
- Implement a `CypherQuery` pydantic `BaseModel` class in [`backend/features/search/models.py`](backend/features/search/models.py:1), with its own `__str__` function that returns itself as a Cypher Query
- Implement a prototype `text_to_cypher` function, which utilizes langchain LLMs, the `CypherQuery`, and `with_structured_output` to create a query from natural language
- Search the FAISS index using the natural language query
- Search the knowledgegraph using the mock function (0.0-1.0 range) with the `CypherQuery`
- Return the top `k` results as `SearchResult` objects.
- Keep the code clean, readable and maintainable.

### 2. Backend: `GET /api/streaming/notepad` (SSE)

In [`backend/features/streaming/router.py`](backend/features/streaming/router.py:1), you'll find a stub GET endpoint for `/api/streaming/notepad`.

Your job:

- Implement Server-Sent Events (SSE) streaming of a plain text file (provided at [`backend/data/notepad.txt`](backend/data/notepad.txt:1)).
- Stream the contents progressively (in chunks) so the browser UI can display text as it arrives.
- Accept optional query params:
  - `path`: path to a `.txt` file (relative paths resolve from the backend working directory)
  - `chunk_size`: number of characters to read per chunk
  - `delay_ms`: optional delay between chunks (helps demonstrate streaming)
- Return helpful HTTP errors (e.g., 404 if the file does not exist).

Notes:

- The backend endpoint currently returns a placeholder SSE event. Candidates should implement the actual streaming.

### 3. TypeScript: API client & search history

Most of the frontend is already wired up with a simple React UI. Your primary tasks are in the TypeScript modules under [`frontend/src/lib`](frontend/src/lib:1).

Your job:

- In [`frontend/src/lib/api.ts`](frontend/src/lib/api.ts:1), implement a type-safe `search(query: string, topK?: number)` function that:
  - Calls the `/api/search` endpoint via `fetch` with a JSON body.
  - Returns a `Promise<SearchResult[]>` parsed from the JSON response.
  - Throws a descriptive error when the response is not OK (e.g., non-2xx status).
- In [`frontend/src/lib/searchHistory.ts`](frontend/src/lib/searchHistory.ts:1), implement pure, immutable helpers to manage recent search queries:
  - Represent each entry as a typed object (e.g., `SearchQuery`) containing the query string and timestamp.
  - Implement an `addToHistory` function that adds a new query, trims history to a maximum size, and avoids duplicate adjacent queries.
  - Implement a `getRecentQueries` function that returns a list of recent query strings in most-recent-first order.
- The React file [`frontend/src/features/search/SearchPage.tsx`](frontend/src/features/search/SearchPage.tsx:1) is already set up to use these helpers to display results and recent searches.
  - You generally do **not** need to modify React components to complete the assignment.
  - Minor adjustments to the UI are fine if they help you structure the TypeScript code cleanly.

Styling is intentionally minimal; focus on clear, well-typed TypeScript logic rather than CSS or advanced React patterns.
